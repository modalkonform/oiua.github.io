Establishing continuous delivery for software development is like building fabrics for digital goods. A full lifecycle from every line of code, config or data passing a pipeline of build, test and deploy finished up in a running app or service. We have done that for decades for several customers of all sizes. We love to share that experience with you.

Areas we typically work in

- continuous integration and delivery setup, tune, migrate
- migrate to/from architecture, cloud, language, service
- setup, upgrade, coach, train Git, Jenkins, Atlassian Tools like Jira and Confluence

But don't put us in a box!
